I developed an inflatable airbag utilizing thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) films and integrated bellows on its upper surface. This design serves as an effective force transmission device, simplifying the construction of rigid structures. Using this technology, we created a multi-legged soft crawling robot that demonstrated adaptability in various environments.
